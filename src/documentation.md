## 6/5/2025 - update pyodide v0.23.0 => v0.25.1
- `The ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR` occurs when the browser encounters a network issue while trying to load resources using the QUIC protocol (used for faster connections). This can be caused by network problems, server downtime, or issues with the CDN hosting the Pyodide files.
- The `wasm instantiation failed` error indicates that the WebAssembly module (`pyodide.asm.wasm`) failed to load, preventing Pyodide from initializing and running Python in the browser.
- The `Network error: Response body loading was aborted` error suggests that the network request for the `.wasm` file was interrupted, likely due to server issues or connectivity problems.
